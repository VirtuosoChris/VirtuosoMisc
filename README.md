Miscellaneous Code and Utilities

printf.h
Variadic template implementation of printf
Type safe and based on ostreams.  
Versions that use a delimiter between list items, append a newline, and append std::endl at the end of output. 
Useful for much more readable printing code, especially for lists of things.  


helperFunctions.h:
Various miscellaneous functions I've found helpful for various tasks.  
Currently: addition and concatenation operators for std::string, templated so you can easily append a number to a string without having to create a stringstream yourself
